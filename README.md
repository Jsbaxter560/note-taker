As depressing as it is, there's literally nothing to see here that functions. I'm still frozen on getting the server I've created to connect to anything else. I've hit a block I wasn't able to work my way through, which is all too common for me, but it doesn't make me want to resort to self abuse the way it used to, so I guess there's progress on that front...

As I've been unable to establish a link between my server and any of the starter code we were given, nor was I able to even get my server to simply react with the browser, I don't have any snippets of code that would give anyone any insight as to how this project was built, I'm just going to say this... Better things are ahead...
